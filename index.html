                  You know that time is your most precious commodity and one

                  Unfortunately, for many years, it just wasn’t possible for me
                  to offer my services to the majority of people who asked.

              Between my podcast, speaking gigs, writing, travel commitments,
              and A-list clients I had very little time.
            </p>
            <p>
              And my $50,000 per year price tag on my services wasn’t a feasible
              option for many people.
            </p>
            <p>
              But I worked hard and long to make some big changes and I finally
              found a way for us to work together.

              Why I Dedicated My Life to Helping Men Get Fit- Physically and
              Mentally
            </h2>
            <p>
              Growing up, I was the weakest, softest, scrawniest kid around.
            </p>
            <p class="font-weight-bold">
              Because of this I had zero self confidence and was painfully shy
              and introverted.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’ve struggled with anxiety, depression, addiction and countless
              bad and self destructive behaviors.
            </p>
            <p class="font-weight-bold">
              When I finally become fully dedicated to fitness it totally
              changed my life.
            </p>
            <p>
              I put fitness before everything else because if you’re not your
              best, strongest, healthiest self you can’t be the person you want
              to be in any other area of your life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once you optimize your own health and well being you can take on
              any challenge and help all those you want to help at a much higher
              level.
